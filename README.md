# KIT202 Tutorial Code

In this repository you will find my demonstration solutions for each of the KIT202 tutorials in Semester 1, 2021.

While browsing the code, it's important to keep in mind that there are many different valid ways of solving the tutorial tasks, and these are just one possible set of examples.

I recommend working through your own solutions before checking those in this repository, using this code purely as a reference and a point of comparison.

Tutorials 1 to 4 can be previewed online at [sheabunge.github.io/kit202-tutorials/](https://sheabunge.github.io/kit202-tutorials/), while tutorial 5 onwards will require some sort of local PHP/MySQL server installed such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
