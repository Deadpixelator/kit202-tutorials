<p>Run marathon for children living in poverty. Children living in poverty face barriers to accessing an education.
	Increasing access to education can improve the overall health and longevity of a society and growing economies. Yet
	in many developing countries, childrenâ€™s access to education can be limited by numerous factors. Therefore, we run
	to raise the fund for kids who need a support for their education.</p>
